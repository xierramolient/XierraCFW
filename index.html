	<span style="color:#ffffff">We re sorry!
	<br><br>XierraCFW Installer is not available at this time, due to a domain move that made previous versions of XierraCFW not run properly. You can only install XierraCFW manually on the website https://xierra.store, and some features may not be present because the version used by XierraCFW Manual is an early development version.<br><br>This web auto installer will work if XierraCFW has been developed better in version 4.92 HFW.<br><br>More info: <a href=https://xierra.cloud/> https://xierra.cloud<br><br><br></br><span>
